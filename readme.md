# Taskodoro

A time management and task list app based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) using AngularJS, Firebase, and Foundation for Apps.

### How it works

This app will allow you to start at *25-minute work session*.

You'll only be able to start a *5-minute break* after each completed work session.

Once you've completed four work sessions, you'll then be given a *30-minute break* timer.

The app will also allow you to keep a record of completed tasks.
